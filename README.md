## Auto Brightness Toggle

I love Auto Brightness ... but I hate when the clouds pass in front of the sun and the room you're in gets a _fraction_ darker and your phone decides "Okay gotta drop the brightness 50%!!!"

Annoyingly, there is no native Quick Settings toggle for enabling/disabling Auto Brightness, so here it is! A no-frills Quick Settings toggle for Auto Brightness!

## ⚠️ Disclosure
I vibe coded this using Claude Sonnet 4.5 on a free account to work solely for my Pixel 10. If you use this on another device, I cannot speak to it's functionality. However, feel free to open an issue with some information and I'll see if I can patch it.
